[112\. Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)


Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return `true` if the tree has a **root-to-leaf** path such that adding up all the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

A **leaf** is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

```
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/18/pathsum2.jpg)

```
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
<strong>Output:</strong> false
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(1 --&gt; 2): The sum is 3.
(1 --&gt; 3): The sum is 4.
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.
```

**Example 3:**

```
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [], targetSum = 0
<strong>Output:</strong> false
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.
```

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
-   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
-   `-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000`
